      <p>
        I am a graduate of  San Diego State University, with a major in Marketing and
        a minor in Television, Film, and Media Studies. I am currently pursuing my
        master's degree at USC in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology,
        which is further enhancing my skills in creative strategy, media, and
        technology. This combination of education has given me a strong foundation
        in both business strategy and creative media, equipping me with a unique skill
        set to succeed across multiple career paths. Through my marketing
        education, I have gained expertise in consumer behavior, marketing
        analytics, and strategic planning. My seven years of experience in film
        inspired me to further explore television, film, and media studies, deepening
        my understanding of storytelling and visual communication. Additionally, I
        am fluent in Spanish, having spent 12 years reading, writing, and speaking the
        language.

        I am eager to explore career opportunities in marketing where I can combine
        strategic thinking with creativity to build innovative campaigns and drive
        company growth. I look forward to connecting with professionals,
        collaborating on projects, and contributing to initiatives that push the
        boundaries of both marketing and entertainment.
